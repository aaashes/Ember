Ember General Info
------------------
Embercoin unfortunately was abandoned by its creator, and the wallet hasn't been worked on since late 2016. The original dev unfortunately could not math and as a result created the highest PoS coin the world has ever seen. Because of this, many devs outside the project have had their eyes on this gem, keen to revive it and prove its worth long term. So hold tight, the phoenix rebirth of Ember is among us.
